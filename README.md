# OpenGL Intro

This repository contains introductory code and examples for getting started with OpenGL. The main purpose of this repository is to get a good understanding of opengl to start my next project, which is a chess engine :D

## Overview

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-platform graphics API that allows developers to create interactive 2D and 3D applications. It provides a standardized way to interact with GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) hardware, making it a powerful tool for graphics programming.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource for individuals interested in understanding the fundamentals of OpenGL. Whether you are a beginner exploring computer graphics or an experienced developer looking to refresh your OpenGL skills, the examples and explanations provided here aim to simplify the learning process.

## Why OpenGL?

- **Cross-Platform**: OpenGL is supported on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. This cross-platform nature makes it an ideal choice for developing applications that need to run on different operating systems.

- **Versatility**: OpenGL is not limited to a specific programming language. It has bindings for many languages, making it accessible to developers using languages such as C++, Python, and Java.

- **Community and Resources**: OpenGL has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of tutorials, documentation, and forums available for developers seeking help and guidance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
